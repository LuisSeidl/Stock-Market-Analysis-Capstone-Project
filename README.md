This is a simple Python Project utlilizing Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib containing a few exercises on how to handle Financial Data using these libraries
It contains a few exercises from plotting the returns of stocks over a period of time up to creating Bollinger Bands using the .std() and the .mean() functions

This was done by me in order to deepen my understanding in these libraries and learning to handle financial data and simple calculations with DataFrames
